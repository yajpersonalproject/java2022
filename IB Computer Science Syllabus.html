      <p>The objective level associated with each command term (see objective column) indicates the depth of treatment for a given assessment statement.</p>
      <ul>
    <li><strong> Assessment objective 1 </strong> : classify, define, draw, label, list, state</li>
    <li><strong> Assessment objective 2 </strong> : annotate, apply, calculate, describe, design, distinguish, estimate, identify, outline, present, trace</li>
    <li><strong> Assessment objective 3 </strong> : analyse, comment, compare, compare and contrast, construct, contrast, deduce, demonstrate, derive, determine, discuss, evaluate, examine, explain, formulate, interpret, investigate, justify, predict, sketch, suggest, to what extent</li>
  </ul>
      <p>Additional notes, which are included alongside some assessment statements, provide further guidance. In these, links to other topics are shown ( <strong> LINK </strong> ), and they may also suggest ideas for the promotion of specific subject aims ( <strong> AIM </strong> ), theory of knowledge ( <strong> TOK </strong> ), Middle Years Programme ( <strong> MYP </strong> ), social/ethical issues ( <strong> S/E </strong> ) and the international dimension ( <strong> INT </strong> ).</p>

      <p>This should not be taught as a separate topic but must be incorporated and connected to all sections--especially flow charts, pseudocode and programming in the SL/HL core and abstract data structures (HL extension). It is essential that these elements are not addressed in isolation--they have to be approached as a whole.</p>
      <p>The basic ideas and their application should be illustrated with non-computer examples. Each basic idea should then be practised in specific algorithmic contexts using concepts drawn from flow charts, pseudocode and programming. The teacher support material illustrates examples such as the home/locker/knapsack for thinking ahead.</p>

      <p><strong> 4.2 Connecting computational thinking and program design (22 hours) </strong></p>
      <p>The focus of this topic is how an understanding of programming languages enhances the students’ understanding of computational thinking and provides them with opportunities for practical, hands-on experience of applying computational thinking to practical outcomes.</p>
      <p>In externally assessed components questions will be presented using flow charts and/or pseudocode as outlined in the approved notation sheet. Answers will only be required in pseudocode.</p>
      <p>Students must be given the opportunity to convert algorithms into working code that is executed and tested.</p>
      <p>Working code will not be assessed in the externally assessed components.</p>
